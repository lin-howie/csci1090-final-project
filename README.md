Analyzing the relationship between economic conditions and PISA test scores from 2003 and 2018

Possible improvements to the project:
* Trying HistoGradientBoostingRegressor or regular GradientBoostingRegressor model
* Tuning models with hyperparameterization
* Determining statistical significance
* Creating a classifier model to predict a good or bad educational circumstance given randomly passed in data
